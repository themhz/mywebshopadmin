Steps when user request URL from browser

1. User types URL

2. Request is received and processed by the web server

3. Request now moves to php and begins Request() method to invoked user requests. This captures all the information from URL and POST information,cookie etc.

4. Request is passed to special class called Router which knows how to route the user to the corresponding controller

5. RouteTable redirect the request to appropriate Controller which passed through the Interface IController and Controller class. 
   The default URL controller to match is /{controller}/{action}/{id}?{querystring}

6. In Controller appropriate action is invokes (as defined in URL), for example index() method

7. The controller then decides which view to render. The convention is to match the name of the action to the name of the view. HomeControllerâ€™s action Index( ) will look in the directory /View/Home and select the file index.php.

8. View is rendered and HTML output is displayed to user.

This is the flow of my MVC.
